# DungeonDorksAndroid

This app serves as a collection of tools for assisting in playing Dungeons and Dragons 5e.

The toolset is currently limited to a simple dice roller with a modifier (d20 only at the moment) and a spell search tool that searches the base spells provided from the D&D 5e API at http://www.dnd5eapi.co/

If you are having trouble getting the API to load data, please check that you have Google DNS set up properly, https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using
